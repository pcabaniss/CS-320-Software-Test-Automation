# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  We have learned in this class that no program can be 100% clean and error free. However, we can strive to reach that perfection through certain methods and 
  stradegies. Specifically, we used JUnit testing to test and assure that our programs code blocks behaved and outputted exactly as they should. This is one of 
  many ways to ensure that your software is behaving as anticipated. As for being secure, we can use things like input validation, and encapsulation of data to
  ensure that the program is protected.

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  These are called requirements, and its one of the most important steps in the software development lifecycle. The clients needds and wants are a roadmap of the
  product that is being developed. Sometimes even the user cant fully express exactly what is needed, and thats why its up us to decipher their needs fully. We 
  have to be sure and listen carefully and always keep discussions open through the development process. Needs and wants can change and its important to maintain
  communication with the client to ensure that changes are implemented successfully. 

# How do I approach designing software?
  Before I went back to school, I approached an idea or program in a hail-mary sort of way. Just dive right in and whatever problems that arise are just a Google 
  away. Since then, I have learned about how important it is to lay out and design your software from the ground up. It gives you a clearer picture of the goal, 
  and the clearer that picture is, the smoother development will be. I now create UML digrams that explain how and what my program will do, and it has made 
  programming more enjoyable, and the development process faster.
